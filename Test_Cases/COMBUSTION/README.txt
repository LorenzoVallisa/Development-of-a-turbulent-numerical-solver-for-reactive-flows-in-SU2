For the mixture it is needed the molar mass (g/mol), the formation enthalpy and the diffusion volume.

For the chemistry it can be seen that there is the possibility to use different exponent for rates than the stoichiometric coefficients specifiying
its value after the symbol _ following the name of the species.
Morevore there is the possibility to add the backward rate specifiying:
  Available Backward Rate reaction + 'number of reaction'
followed by Arrhenius parameter, temprature exponent and activation temperature (or energy).
